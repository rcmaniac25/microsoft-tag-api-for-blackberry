TODO:
Implement tag support
Test "services"
Modify implemented components so it is more developer friendly
-Rewrite so instead of it being a generated system it is a organized implementation of the service that is as memory efficent as possible
Implement more types.
Create client class
Test

NOTE:
Implemented service is copy of service generated with wscompile (see below) which waas then modified to its current state. This has been done so that the service can be generated in the most memory/process efficient manner and handle the sub tag types that require more complex code then what is generated by wscompile.

Service generation:
-Service stub classes are generated with "wscompile -gen -cldc1.1 -f:searchschema -d {dest folder} config.xml" where config.xml is:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/jax-rpc/ri/config">
  <wsdl location="https://ws.tag.microsoft.com/MIBPService.wsdl" packageName="mstag.services" />
</configuration>
-Then the following classes has "java.io.ObjectStreamException" removed from "readResolve" so it will compile:
UserAuthFaultReason
TagStatus
TagFaultReason
SenderFaultReason
SenderFaultReason
DecorationType
CategoryStatus
CategoryFaultReason
CategoryFaultReason
-IMIBPContract_Stub should have the following changes made:
--_type_UTCStartDate's Type is changed from "UNKNOWN" to "Type.STRING"
--_type_UTCEndDate's Type is changed from "UNKNOWN" to "Type.STRING"
--_type_GetBarcodeResult's Type is changed from "UNKNOWN" to "Type.STRING"
-Then go through everything that uses getUTCStartDate and getUTCEndDate and surround the code with a call to "Util.toSOAPString"
-For _type_GetBarcodeResult, go to the bottom of "getBarcode" (where it is used) and replace "result = (byte[])getBarcodeResultObj;" with:
try
{
	result = Base64InputStream.decode((String)getBarcodeResultObj);
}
catch (IOException e)
{
	result = null;
}
-Remove all "function classes", for example for CreateTag there are 2 classes, CreateTag and CreateTagResponse. Both are unnecessary.
